# Console app
A raytraycer that also can render halos and rainbows

Controls:
WASD to move, mouse to look around
Space/LShift - move up/down
F5 - screenshot (a screenshot is done automatically every 5 minutes)


Arrows:
up/down - aperture
left/right - focus


F/R - FOV
G/T - exposure
H/Y - white
Delete - focus on origin (0,0,0)
Mouse left - reset render progress


I am not a programmer so I have no idea how to write a setup guide and I guess you might struggle if you would for some reason want to do that. Just look at some mildly edited pictures produced by it
